I am having problems in a production environment mixing new tech (vite/esbuild) with older tech (marionette/backbone/jquery) in an openlayers project so this is a minimal environment to reproduce and then resolve my problems.

The specific issue is esbuild cannot find my "ol" packages but when I standup a new ol-esbuild project, like the one in ./ol-esbuild, it works fine.
